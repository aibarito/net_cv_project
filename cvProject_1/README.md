### Troubleshooting
1) The date format to input is not very conveinent, but works
2) The id of neither of projects nor task is should not be specified during the post actions. It is because the server side automatically keeps track of them. Therefore, in case of modifications I've error messages.
3) The task can not be moved from one project to another, because I fixed each task to a project.
